# **Fintech Fortress: A Distributed Banking System**

## **Project Overview**  
Fintech Fortress is a secure and fault-tolerant distributed banking system designed to enhance modern financial services. It integrates **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) authentication** using the **Schnorr Protocol**, ensuring strong and private user authentication. The system also employs **real-time database synchronization**, **database replication**, and **automated failover mechanisms** to ensure continuous service availability and protection against data inconsistencies.

## **Key Features**  
### **Security & Authentication**  
- 🔒 **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Authentication** using the **Schnorr Protocol** ensures secure authentication without revealing sensitive user credentials.  
- 🔑 **Database encryption** protects stored information from unauthorized access.  
- 🔐 **Secure Sessions** use HTTPS/TLS to prevent data interception.  

### **Distributed System Architecture**  
- 🖥 **Dual-Server Architecture** with a primary and backup server to maintain high availability.  
- 🔄 **Automated Failover Mechanisms** redirect traffic to the backup server during failures.  
- 🗄 **Database Replication & Synchronization** ensure redundancy and fault tolerance.  

### **Core Banking Features**  
- 👤 **Account Management** (User profiles, account updates).  
- 💰 **Secure Transactions** (Deposits, Withdrawals, Transfers).  
- 📜 **Transaction History** with real-time logs.  
- 📢 **Real-time Notifications** for account activity.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Backend:** Python, Flask  
- **Database:** SQLite3 with replication and caching (Redis)  
- **Security Protocols:** Schnorr Protocol (ZKP), Data Encryption  
- **Distributed Technologies:** TCP/IP, Multi-threading  

## **System Implementation**  
- 🌍 **Web-based application** with an administrator and client dashboard.  
- ⚖️ **Load Balancer** for distributing client requests efficiently.  
- ⚡ **Caching Mechanism** to reduce database load and improve response time.
